After downloading all the dependencies, there were literally thousands of files to upload to Github. Github doesn’t allow you to upload more than 100 files at once, so I only uploaded the files I changed. I hope this isn’t a problem.

1.The bug with the ‘grade’ program is that there is no Calculator.ex class.
Another bug with the stubs is that there should be an underscore before the ‘mark’ field, as to indicate that it is not being used.

2. Here is the stub code for calculating percentage, numeric, and letter grade.
